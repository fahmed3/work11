      <p>
	And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! I can explain. It's very valuable. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
<br><br>
Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Ooh, name it after me! I never loved you. Anyone who laughs is a communist!
<br><br>
Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. It's toe-tappingly tragic! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. And I'm his friend Jesus.
<br><br>
I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very
<br><br>
Kids have names? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Tell her she looks thin. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
<br><br>
Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
<br><br>
Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! We're also Santa Claus! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
<br><br>
Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
<br><br>
Really?! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Pansy. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
<br><br>
Negative, bossy meat creature! A true inspiration for the children. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
<br><br>
	We're rescuing ya. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Belligerent and numerous. That's not soon enough! But I've never been to the moon!
	</p>

      <h2 id = "help"> How to Help </h2>
      <p>
Soon enough. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Yes! In your face, Gandhi! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
<br><br>
Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
<br><br>
Bender, you risked your life to save me! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!
<br><br>
Negative, bossy meat creature! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Ooh, name it after me! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! A true inspiration for the children.
<br><br>
Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it then perhaps gifts!
<br><br>
Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? How much did you make me? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
<br><br>
Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.
<br><br>
But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Anyone who laughs is a communist!
<br><br>
Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
<br><br>
Pansy. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Negative, bossy meat creature! They're like sex, except I'm having them! Soon enough. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
<br><br>
Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Professor, make a woman out of me. We're also Santa Claus!

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
<br><br>
OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. You know, I was God once. Your best is an idiot! Why not indeed! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!
<br><br>
Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.
<br><br>
Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! One hundred dollars. Hey, whatcha watching?
